# Creating fact sheets

The fact sheet function allows the administrator to configure individual views for users. 

The configuration of a fact sheet is like the start page configuration, except that for the descriptions there are only the text, list and placeholder widgets available as building blocks.

The following example shows how to create and edit fact sheet for processes. Fact sheets can only be created by administrators.

Navigate to admin area and click on the **Fact sheets** tile.

![Navigate into fact sheets](media/AdminPanel.png "Navigate into fact sheets")

On the left side of the screen **insert a name** for the fact sheet and click on **New**.

![Create new fact sheet](media/NewFactSheet.png "Create new fact sheet")
![Create new fact sheet](media/CreatedFactSheet.png "Create new fact sheet")
After creating new fact sheet, you will see in **Detail content** on the right side, options for that new fact sheet, such as **Name**, **Description** and **Type Settings**, **Permissions** and **Style**.
In **Type Settings**, you must choose the **facet** and **element type** for which the fact sheet is valid for. In our example, we will choose facet *Processes* and element type *Sub Processes*.

After you choose facet and element type you can move to the middle part of the screen, in the **graphics view**.

In the toolbar click on  **New**, and **choose** from the dropdown list the desired widget.

In our example, we will choose **Text Widget**, **Picture Widget** and **List Widget**.
