# Consolidation of extended configurations

## Description
With this feature activated, you have the possibility to consolidate multiple given customizations of the same type to one customization containing the settings of the customizations.

An exemplary use case for this feature is the usage of two identical **custom dropdown values** in two different **dropdown attributes**. You can now select one of the custom **values** as a **'master'** attribute with the other custom **value** as a **'slave'**. Consolidating these two values will result in the **master** overtaking the **attribute types** of the **slave** while the latter is deleted.

As a result, the **master** attribute will now be available on all **attribute types** the **slave** was available on.

Like already mentioned, please note that you can consolidate multiple **slave** values into one **master** value as well.
