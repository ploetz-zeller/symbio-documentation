# Method: Systems as a list (instead of architecture) 

This feature is made for performance optimization. Once activated, the 'architecture' view in the SYSTEMS facet is deactivated.

Objects can thus not be created in a hierarchical structure, but only in form of a list. This is useful for users who have not grouped their systems into Building Blocks and have therefore had to accept longer loading times.
