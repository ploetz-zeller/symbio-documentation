# Deactivate architecture in SYSTEMS facet (Preview feature)

This feature is made for performance optimization. Once activated, the 'architecture' view in the SYSTEMS facet is deactivated.

Objects can thus not be created in a hierarchical structure, but only in form of a list. This is useful for users who have not grouped their systems into Building Blocks and have therefore had to accept longer loading times.
