# List view: Additional column 'Reason for revision' for 'News' lists

You have the possibility to place lists on the home site, which show 'News' about processes and documents, which means a list of the latest released processes and documents. 

The feature adds a new information next to the column 'Type of Change' to that lists: it shows additionally the attribute 'Reason for revision', which explains, why the new version of the item has been created. 
The attribute 'Reason for revision' is a multiline text attribute. It is shown as plain text without any formatting.
