#### Related type

The selection '**Related Type**' depends on the Relation Type you selected earlier. Here you can either see the elements which are connected to the valid types **or** the elements which are contained in the valid type.

### Properties
Here you can select the properties of the the related type you would like to see in the table widget

### Inverted properties
Similar to properties, you can see the properties of the related type you would like to see. With the difference, that values of the property are listed as columns.

### Inverted Properties Width
Set a fixed width of each of the **inverted properties** columns and align them to the right side of the table widget. We suggest a starting value of 50 to 100 and adjust accordingly.
If this value is set to 0, both properties and inverted properties columns will be spaced evenly.

### Personalized Data
This setting allows you to utilize your scope filters.

Once you have configured all the values inside of your customization, please remember to activate the customization and to click on **'Apply changes'** in the toolbar.
