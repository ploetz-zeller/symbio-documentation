# Method: Documents as a list (instead of architecture)


With this feature, Document facet has only list view. 
After activation all documents from architecture are shown as a list.
After deactivation newly created documents are set in orphaned view. The one that were in architecture are set back in hierarchy. 

This feature should not be activated if there is any dependency to external interfaces which uses the document architecture or if the feature "Subscriptions on categories" is activated
