# Method: Documents on process structure level

By activating this feature, it is possible to assign documents to the global _process house_ diagram and/or to process categories, in order to show them as globally applicable/important for all processes or for a whole process category. 

When a document is assigned to the process house or to a process category, this is also visible in the detail content of the document, if the feature is activated.
