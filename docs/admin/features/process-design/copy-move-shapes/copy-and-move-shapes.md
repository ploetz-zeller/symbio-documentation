Activating this feature enables the Author to copy or move process flow objects. Selected objects can be copied or moved either within a process or to another existing process of the Process House. 

It is recommended to deactivate this feature in case of performance issues. As long it is deactivated, the corresponding icons do not appear in the Toolbar of the Main Content.
