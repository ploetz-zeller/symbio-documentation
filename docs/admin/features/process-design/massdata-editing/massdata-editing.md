The Admin is now allowed to edit a large number of linked objects quickly, e.g. of roles, responsible persons or scope filters. Existing elements can be removed or changed as well as new elements can be added.

Please note that only elements with state "in progress" can be edited. In case that objects are selected by mistake although they are not connected they are treated as to be removed.
