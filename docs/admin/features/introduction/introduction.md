# Introduction

An important extension of the Continuous Delivery method is the option for customers to activate or deactivate the new functions for the application. In this way, you decide whether a new function should be applied for productive use or whether it has no relevance for your company. We recommend to apply it in a testing environment first. Please be aware that the feature activation will take some minutes to complete. 

For more details, please refer to our [Continuous Delivery approach](https://www.symbioworld.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/Symbio-Continuous-Delivery.pdf)

In the following sections you will find a short description of all features and their current feature flag period 'Experimental', 'Preview' or 'Released'.
