# Introduction

An important extension of the Continuous Delivery method is the option for customers to activate or deactivate the new functions for the application. In this way, you decide whether a new function should be applied for productive use or whether it has no relevance for your company. We recommend to apply it in a testing environment first. Please be aware that the feature activation will take some minutes to complete. 

In the following sections you will find a short description of all features. 

For the management of features, please refer to [Configuration - Features](https://docs.symbioworld.com/admin/administration/storage-configuration/storage-configuration/) for more details.
