### 6.6.1 AML import

In Symbio, it is possible to import processes from ARIS. Importing of ARIS data mostly needs a customized config file to import ARIS data successfully.
ARIS data should be imported to an empty database unless you are absolutely sure that the GUIDs which will be imported do not exist in the target database already.  

#### 6.6.1.1 Configuration for AML import

To import ARIS data, it is required to set up the AML-import converter first. To do so navigate to administration page and choose AML import.
