By clicking on the widget, the Detail Content appears where you can determine the design and the content (i.e. maturity level analysis) of the widget. 
You can also choose name, description, size, background and text color. 
Depending on the kind of the widget there are various design and content capabilities. For example, they can be set to specific sizes, e.g. 2x2, 3x3. Maximum is a column count of 8.

Moving widgets to another position on the page is done by clicking on them and then using the arrow which appears. At the moment, widgets can only be moved to the left.

## Permit home sites

Symbio supports the configuration of home sites for different user groups. In the Navigation tree, the admin creates a new site and creates the page as described above. After the page has been configured, an authorization group is assigned to the page. According to this principle, the administrator constructs the home sites for the groups and then authorizes the page in detail content.

## Import home sites

If you have modified our default home site, you need to remove our default home site in new storages before import.

Moreover please use XML export and not SYMX for Startpages.
