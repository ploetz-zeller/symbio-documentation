# Settings

## Facets

In Symbio, all Navigations and Sub Navigations are called "facets". They are used to display processes, organization, repository objects, etc. 

It is possible to set permissions so that only specific user groups can add or edit a facet.

## Variants

Global and local variants are set up via the tile Variants on the administration page.

Additionally, the administrator can define tags via the tile Tags to be used together with variants.

## Tags

Only users with administration rights can create tags. Tags can be used in the user fly out menu to filter processes and repository items in list views (e.g. start page). Existing tags be connected to processes and repository objects.

## Languages

In Symbio, several LCID languages are support. Mostly, English (1033) and German (1031) are used. The entire user interface (UI) is localized and the process data culture is activated for the selected languages. Releasing a process/repository item is only allowed if mandatory attributes are set for corresponding cultures and in case of importing process data only configured cultures will be imported.
English (1033) is the default language.
Other languages can be added as well. It is also possible to remove a language here, except the default language.

Note: If the Symbio installation administrator has activated the translation feature via the Web.config, language-dependent attributes are **NOT automatically translated** online. Please use the Translate button in the Detail Content. The source language corresponds to the user's language settings.

After adding a new language it's required to click on __Apply changes__ in the toolbar.

To add a disclaimer text, please use the disclaimer input box.

### Privacy settings

The privacy settings currently consist of two settings which can be disabled if company guidelines require it because of work council or other reasons.

a. Request enables the option for users to provide feedback on process elements like main/sub processes and repository items. Even in Viewer mode.

b. Global feedback enables the option to provide general Symbio Web application feedback via survey by using the smiley in header bar.

### Process released notification of external systems

Feature to enable e-mail notifications about tasks. Customized mail template text can be configured.

### Region settings

The region settings are not set in Symbio default settings so the web server´s regional setting (region and time zone) are used. If regional settings are set, then time stamps in the user interface will reflect these, e.g. in attributes of processes or release tasks. The user can still overwrite these settings by setting user-dependent regional settings in the user’s profile in Symbio users management.

### Theme settings

The default Symbio theme can be customized by changing the colors of the header and navigation bars. It is also possible to replace the Symbio logo with your own logo.
To activate new theme settings, please press on Compile button and then press F5 to refresh the browser window to make the changes visible. To reset the theme back to the Symbio theme, press the Reset button.
We recommend, for example, embedding the corporate identity only in the productive database in order to make a clear difference to the testing system.
