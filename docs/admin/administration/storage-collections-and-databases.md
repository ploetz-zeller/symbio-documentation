## Configuration templates

### Embed configuration template

Before you create a database, it is absolutely necessary to select a configuration template and then integrate it. Please select the configuration template in the detail area of the database to be created and select a corresponding template.

Symbio comes with predefined configuration templates after installation. However, the configuration may differ from the standard. If there is a special configuration, please navigate via the home page to the tile "Configuration Templates".

### Add new configuration template (optional)

Here an extension by a new template is necessary first. A corresponding configuration file is uploaded. It is recommended to store these SYTX files in the App_Data directory of Symbio. Afterwards the file can be selected via the Upload Screen without having to specify a directory.
