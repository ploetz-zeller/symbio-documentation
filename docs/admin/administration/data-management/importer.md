## AML import

In Symbio, it is possible to import processes from ARIS. Importing of ARIS data mostly needs a customized config file to import ARIS data successfully.
ARIS data should be imported to an empty database unless you are absolutely sure that the GUIDs which will be imported do not exist in the target database already.  

### Configuration for AML import

To import ARIS data, it is required to set up the AML-import converter first. To do so navigate to administration page and choose AML import.

After the new configuration has been created, click on Add in the detail content and follow the dialogue window to add the file. Custom configuration file is important for ARIS data to be imported successfully.

The process will run in background and will take some time depending on ARIS xml file size. You can watch the event log, as well as download the report of the process in Info-board.

After successful import you will find imported processes under Processes > Orphaned. If processes are not visible, please refresh the list. It can be also customized that imported Aris processes are part of the process house.
