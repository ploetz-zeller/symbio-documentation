## Log files

Log files from Symbio application folder can be retrieved here. By default, only errors will be logged. Please contact your Symbio IT Administrator if the logging level needs to be increased to include warnings and informational log messages by changing settings in the Web.config file during downtime.

## Apply new configuration

If the configuration/method (SYTX) has been changed only and the changes are not directly visible, the Admin can force the configuration change here but it should not be necessary.

## Generate reporting scripts

SQL Reporting Services Database relevant only. Please contact us if you like to use Reporting within Symbio.
