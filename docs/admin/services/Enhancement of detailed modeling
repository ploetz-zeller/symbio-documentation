# Enhancement of detailed modeling

Please note that this feature will be activated by default in all future versions and cannot be manually disabled.

For performance reasons, the update of a process graphic wonâ€™t be triggered automatically when a repository object is added or changed. The user himself determines the time of the graphical update by click on the blue refresh button in the Toolbar. Modelling or deleting processes or objects are still updated automatically, since these changes have consequences for the structure of the process. 

The described principle does not apply to the deletion of objects and to the general modeling of processes as those changes have consequences to the process structure. In these cases, Symbio will both update the process model and cache changes between two updates automatically.
