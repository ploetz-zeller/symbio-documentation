# Versioning

Three important componentes have to be choosen properly when installing on premise for the SAP Solution Manager interface to work properly:
 1.Symbio
 2.SAP Solution Manager interface
 3..syex configuration file
 
The rules when one of the three componets updates:
Rule: No update of Symbio or SAP Solution Manager interface without updating the other!

Update of Symbio
- If Symbio is updated also SAP Solution Manager interface has to be updated
- Test custom attributes update (new custom attribute)

Update of SAP Solution Manager interface
- if a new version of SAP Solution Manager interface is using a new endpoint from Rest API then Symbio has to be updated (if there is a change like this inform admin and he knows that he has to update Symbio)

Update of SAP Solution Manager
- SAP Solution Manager interface has to be updated, Symbio should not be updated

All of the tree components have to be choosen right in order for the SAP Solution Manager interface to work properly.
