# Versioning

Three important components have to be chosen properly when installing on premise for the SAP Solution Manager interface to work properly:
 1. Symbio
 2. SAP Solution Manager interface
 3. .syex configuration file
 
**The RULE when one of the three components updates:
Rule: No update of Symbio or SAP Solution Manager interface without updating the other!**

NOTE: *Latest .syex file is included in latest Symbio artifact files*

Update of Symbio
- If Symbio is updated also SAP Solution Manager interface has to be updated
- Integration test should all pass

Update of SAP Solution Manager interface
- Symbio has to be updated
- Integration test should all pass

Update of SAP Solution Manager
