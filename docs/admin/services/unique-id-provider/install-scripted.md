```PowerShell
.\Install-SymbioWeb.ps1 -ParametersFile .\symbio-service-uniqueid.parameters.json
```

*`nice to know`*

*- if you use a domain user. You must write [server] \\\\\\\\ [user].*

*- You can omit the specification of the Files parameter by renaming symbio-service-uniqueid.parameters.json to parameter.json. The script detects the JSON itself, if they are in the same folder.*
