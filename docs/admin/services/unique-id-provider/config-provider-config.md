To illustrate this, a prefix "Role-ID-" is selected and "{0}" is set
behind it.

Thus, for example, this prefix is always used with each newly created ID
for a role, followed by an ascending number.

The field "Valid for Attribute Type" defines for which attribute this ID
is entered in a role. In this example, the created ID is to be written
to the ID attribute of the object.
