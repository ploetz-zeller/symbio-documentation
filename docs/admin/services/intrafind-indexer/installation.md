| IISSettings.Bindings | List of bindings
| IISSettings.Bindings.Protocol | The protocol contains *http* or *https*
| IISSettings.Bindings.IPAddress | The IP address to use. Default is * for all IP addresses.
| IISSettings.Bindings.Port | The port is an integer. The default port for *http* is 80 and for *https* 443.
| IISSettings.Bindings.HostName | The hostname for the binding. Use * for all hostnames.
| IISSettings.Bindings.CertificateHash | The thumbprint hash of the certificate you want to use. ([This is how you get the fingerprint.](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/framework/wcf/feature-details/how-to-retrieve-the-thumbprint-of-a-certificate)) This parameter is optional if you maintain the CertificateCN.
| IISSettings.Bindings.CertificateCN | The CN of the certificate. This can be found in the details of the certificate as field `Subject`.
| IISSettings.Bindings.SslFlag | The optional parameter SslFlag is responsible for activating SNI in the binding. Set 1 to activate SNI ([What is SNI?](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/iis/get-started/whats-new-in-iis-8/iis-80-server-name-indication-sni-ssl-scalability)).

#### AppSettings

| Name | Description
| --- | --- |
| ConfigStoreConnection | Your SQL-Server connection string
| [SQLSERVER] | Name or address (including the port) of your database server
| ConfigStoreTableName | The name of your configuration database. This is an optional setting.

### Running the Script

If all settings are corretly set, please start a new powershell console as Administrator, change into the directory of the downloaded script, and run the following command:

```PowerShell
.\Install.ps1 -ParametersFile .\symbio-service-intrafindindexer.parameters.json
```

*`nice to know`*

*- If you use a domain user. You must write [server]\\[user].*

*- You can omit the specification of the Files parameter by renaming symbio-service-intrafindindexer.parameters.json to parameters.json. The script detects the JSON itself, if they are in the same folder.*

*- If you already operate a fully configured IIS on the target machine, you can use the switch `-WithoutIIS`. This turns off the checking and installation of the IIS components.
This is only recommended if you have already executed the script at least once with a successful IIS configuration.*

## Conclusion

You have now set up the II. The next step is configuring it in Symbio.
