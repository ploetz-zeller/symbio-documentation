# Reporting Console 

## Requirements

To set up the **Reporting Console** you will need a machine with a current version of the .NET Core runtime installed. This machine needs access to [Symbio](config-symbio.md), connection to the [Reporting Connector](reporting-connector.md) and the ODS database.

## Installation on a Windows machine

1. Create a directory to host the files of the console application, e.g. _C:\SymbioServices\Reporting\Console_
2. Copy all files and folders of the application into this directory

## Configuration

Currently, no special configuration is necessary.
