# Logging

## Common information

Serilog is used for logging. Configuration is done in appsettings.json. 
See Serilog's [documentation](https://github.com/serilog/serilog/wiki/Configuration-Basics) for further information.

The default settings will create a Logs sub-folder in the Connector service's application path and store there 
log-files on a per-day file basis. The default log file name pattern is 'symbio-service-intrafind-connector-log-YYYYMMDD.txt'.
Default log level is INFORMATION.
Log level DEBUG gives detailed information in case of problems.
Log level VERBOSE is really for tracing down problems and may slow down the hosting system.
It should not be left at that value without good reason.

A live-view of today's current log file is possible by

    powershell gc -wait [logfile]

Please see Serilog's documentation on how to set up notification for log file errors. E.g., e-mail notification can be done by the [e-mail sink](https://github.com/serilog/serilog-sinks-email).

## Errors

##### "Event 'Elements have changed' but connection-state is invalid: [ConnectionState]. Stopping further processing."
