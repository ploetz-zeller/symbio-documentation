If you can answer every question with Yes, your infrastructure is Ready for Symbio SSO.

| SAML 2.0-compliant IdP available?                     | &#9744; Yes &#9744; No |
| SSO HTTP-REDIRECT endpoint supported?                 | &#9744; Yes &#9744; No |
| POST to ACS endpoint supported?                       | &#9744; Yes &#9744; No |

#### Claims Details

| Additional Question                   | Answer (needed by P+Z for Cloud setups) |
| ------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------- |
| Claim Type users are identified by?   | (UPN preferred)                         |
| Claim Type used for group membership? | (Group preferred)                       |

If these answers diverge from the desired claim types, a custom claims mapping needs to be added.
