   ![Configure Website](media/configure-website.png)

#### Recommendation

Create for each environment (Test and Prod) a website.

## Basic settings

Please unpack the Symbio Web installation package on the applications server.

**Recommendation:**
It is recommended to provide two parallel installations:

- C:\Symbio\SymbioWebTest
- C:\Symbio\SymbioWebProd

**Note:**
The database is created automatically at the start of the application.

## Settings in the configuration file (Web.config)

### Database mode: Pool, Single or Multi

**Notice:**
In addition to the database modes known so far, the pool mode has been added for version 1808. This mode will be activated by default. Please comment on the following lines shown on the Screenshot from the Web.config to deactivate this feature. For further Information about the databasemode pool please check the admin and operations manual.

![WebConfig](media/WebConfig.jpg)

- With the setting **\&lt;add key=&quot;SYMBIO\_WEB\_DB\_MODE&quot; value=&quot;Multiple&quot; /\&gt;** an SQl database is created for each collection or storage created in Symbio.

- With the setting **\&lt;add key=&quot;SYMBIO\_WEB\_DB\_MODE&quot; value=&quot;Single&quot; /\&gt;** only one SQL database is created which contains all data.

- With the setting **\&lt;add key=&quot;SYMBIO\_WEB\_DB\_MODE&quot; value=&quot;Pool&quot; /\&gt;** For each pool, an SQL database is created that contains all the storages created and assigned in it, including data.

The standard setting is: â€ž**Pool**&quot;

**Configure database server:**

- With the setting **SYMBIO\_STORAGE\_LOCATION** and **SYMBIO\_STORAGE\_SETTINGS** you can configure the SQL Server and the SQL database which is to be used.

  ![WebConfig B](media/WebConfig_B.jpg)

|     |     |
| --- | --- |
| **Server** | srv-db\COMMON |
| **Database** | SymbioWebDB |

**Note:**
For each installation (Test / Prod) a unique database name must be selected.

### Configure initial database sizes (since Symbio Web 5.6)

If the Symbio database is configured for Multi-DB mode, then several settings can be configured to set the initial database file size (MDF) and the initial log file size (LDF):

- SqlServer.Multiple.Tenant.DataSize
- SqlServer.Multiple.Tenant.LogSize

The AutoGrowth values for database and log files can be set in:

- SqlServer.Multiple.Tenant.DataFileGrowth
- SqlServer.Multiple.Tenant.LogFileGrowth

**Notice:**
These values which can be configured here need to be equal or larger than the ModelDB settings otherwise databases cannot be created. ![WebConfig C](media/WebConfig_C.jpg)

### Setting for update interval of rendering diagrams (since Symbio 5.6)

Since Symbio Web 5.6 diagrams are stored into the database so that opening of diagrams in Viewer mode is much faster. If the diagram is updated, e.g. because the executing role of an interface has been changed, then this change is only visible after a maximum of 30 seconds. This value can be configured in **Symbio.BackgroundRenderingUpdateInterval** and is currently set to 30 seconds.

![WebConfig D](media/WebConfig_D.jpg)

If this setting does not exist, an internal value of 60 seconds will be used.

### Settings for Free&amp;Easy environments (since Symbio 5.8)

With Symbio Web 5.8 a Free&amp;Easy mode has been introduced which can restrict certain aspects of the release workflow. Besides a customized configuration the setting &#39;Symbio. RestrictReleaseWorkflowDatabaseNameRegex&#39; has to be activated. The value contains the regular expression that is used to match the current storage name and determine whether to activate the Free&amp;Easy mode.

```` xml
<add key="Symbio.RestrictReleaseWorkflowDatabaseNameRegex" value="^sandbox-" />;
````

### Settings for server error pages (since Symbio 5.8)

Since Symbio Web 5.8, in case of Web server errors only a single generic error page is displayed to hide private (server) data to users. For debugging purposes detailed error pages can be activated in the Web.config:

```` xml
<customErrorsmode="Off" defaultRedirect="~/Errors/error.html"/>
````

### Settings for encrypted communication via HTTPS (since Symbio 5.8)

Since Symbio Web 5.8, it&#39;s configurable in the Web.config whether all web server communications should be transmitted encrypted.

To enable HTTPS, an SSL certificate is required and this setting needs to be activated:

```` xml
<!-- <httpCookies requireSSL="true" />-->
````

### Settings for Symbio Web security (since Symbio 5.9)

Since Symbio Web 5.9, the following 5.8 security settings have been enabled:

```` xml
<httpProtocol>
 <customHeaders>
    <clear />
    <addname="Strict-Transport-Security" value="max-age=16070400; includeSubDomains" />
    <addname="X-XSS-Protection" value="1; mode=block" />
    <addname="X-Content-Type-Options" value="nosniff" />
    <addname="X-Frame-Options" value="SAMEORIGIN" />
  </customHeaders>;
</httpProtocol>;
````

**Note:**
If images are not displayed in browser (e.g. IE 11) or external sites cannot be accessed by Symbio plug-ins, these security settings should be disabled for testing purposes. Please note that after modifying the Web.config the application pool restarts. Please validate settings in your test environment first.
