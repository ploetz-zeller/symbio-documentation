## 4.3 Permit home sites

Symbio supports the configuration of home sites for different user groups. In the Navigation tree, the admin creates a new site and creates the page as described in 3.2. After the page has been configured, an authorization group is assigned to the page. According to this principle, the administrator constructs the home sites for the groups and then authorizes the page in detail content.
