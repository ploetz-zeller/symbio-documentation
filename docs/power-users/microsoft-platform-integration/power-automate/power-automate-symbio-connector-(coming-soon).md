# Power Automate Symbio Connector 
![Coming Soon](../../../media/coming-soon.png)



## Creating a connection


To create a connection with Symbio you need a connection string. To get the connection string, go to the Admin Page > Services > Automation and create a new authentication token (or use an existing one) under the data-Rest-API endpoint. This token needs Architect permissions if you want to use the full feature set provided by the Symbio Connector. The Power Automate Connection String can be found within the detail pane of the token (see below).

Copy the connection string and paste it into the Power Automate Connection String settings window after giving your connection an appropriate name.
